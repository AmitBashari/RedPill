  Name: You give Charlotte the medication and curiousness takes over your better
    judgement. While she regains he strength you tell her you didn't know the pie
    has nuts in it, but also about the torn up photo.... You lie that you ask to
    occupy her mind elsewhere, but it's just because you really want to know.
  Plot: "Also socks. \nMom always says socks and underwear must be changed every
    day - that's why you got two pairs of each."
