  Plot: 'Charlotte is smiling at you and takes a bite of the Nut-Free Chocolate mousse.

    She
    didn''t understand your reference. It''s okay, she''s been hurt as well. You
    will forgive.

    Charlotte took just a couple of bites but you finished the
    whole mousse. She asks if you can walk her home.

    You nod and smile, a few
    specks of chocolate still on the corners of your mouth.'
