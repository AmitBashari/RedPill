  Name: It's a good thing these socks are ruined! This just adds another level of
    disrespect to that team.
  Plot: 'With a flamboyant gesture you throw the socks in the nearest bin. Charlotte
    looks at you shockingly, her mouth curves into a slight smile. You pull out a
    neon-green lighter and light one of the socks.

    A flame begins to take form.

    Charlotte
    moves closer and puts your arm around her, as you bask in the warm light.'
