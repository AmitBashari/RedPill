  Name: You give Charlotte the medication and your face starts heating up with rage.
    While she regains her strength you say that you knew the dessert has nuts in
    it, and call her a Barcelona hater.
  Plot: Charlotte is looking furious. She grabs a pencil from the waiter trying to
    help her up, and stabs you in the stomach with it. You fall to the ground and
    fumble to take the pencil out of your flesh as you watch Charlotte being escorted
    to the ambulance by the hunky waiter, his hands propping her lower back.
