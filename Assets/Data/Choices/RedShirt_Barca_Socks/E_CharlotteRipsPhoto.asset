  Name: You give Charlotte the medication and curiousness takes over your better
    judgement. While she regains her strength you ask about the torn up photo.  You
    just really want to know.
  Plot: 'Charlotte stares at you blankly.

    You ask her again about the photo,
    she might have not heard you the first time. She swallows her saliva slowly while
    lifting her eyes from the ground to pierce yours.

    Her breath slowed down,
    hair is messy and her face is still a light shade of red. She looked menacing.

    Are
    you kind of digging it?

    She says it belonged to her cheating ex-husband,
    and you are an inconsiderate jerk for ever bringing it up.

    You back away
    slowly, trying to fade into the shadows.

    Guess curiosity did kill the cat.'
