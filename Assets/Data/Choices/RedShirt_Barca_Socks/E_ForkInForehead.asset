  Name: Sounds like the guy knew what he was talking about. You never met a Barcelona
    fan you didn't like.
  Plot: Charlotte pounds on the table with her fist, grunting in frustration. She
    throws the Nut-Free chocolate mousse in your face. Then proceeds to throw utensils
    at you. The fork that used to be on the table is now lodged in your forehead,
    warm gooey substance dripping down your cheeks. You manage to see her grin maliciously
    before your eyes glaze over, and your head falls to the table.
