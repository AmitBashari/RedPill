  Name: You never a question the decisions of a Barcelona fan. She must have done
    something wrong.
  Plot: 'Charlotte is letting out a disgusted roar and reaches for the candlestick,
    her eyes turning crazy-red.

    You stumble around on the clothes laying on
    the floor.

    Charlotte moves closer and  with a hateful sneer she bashes your
    head in, your body dropping to the hardwood floor of her apartment.'
