  Name: apologize to the stage manager profusely for your tardiness. You promise
    to make it up to him.
  Plot: 'In your dressing room, you begin the routine of putting your "Game Face"
    on. Soft music plays in the background and a small window nearby is letting a
    cool breeze in. Suddenly the door opens and the stage manager stands in the doorway.
    You are startled. He looks you up and down, lingering on your socks before apologizing
    for intruding.


    The stage manager apologizes again. He says he only came
    to tell you that this is the second time your''e late, third strike and you''re
    out. You can feel his disappointment. It feels like Suarez free-kicked a ball
    right into your chest.'
