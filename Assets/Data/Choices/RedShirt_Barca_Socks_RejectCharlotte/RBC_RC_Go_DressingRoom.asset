  Plot: 'You take off your clothes and fold them neatly on the chair next to you.
    You wonder if you have time to catch a quick shower before the show. Suddenly,
    the stage manager knocks on the door. You open it timidly, trying to hide yourself
    behind a bath towel. A gust of wind tries to undress you but ends up just blowing
    one of your socks to the floor.


    The stage manager walks in and closes the
    door behind him. He says he never suspected your''e a Barcelona fan, so is he.
    He walks closer to you. He continues to say that it all makes sense now, that''s
    the reason you have such good work ethics.'
