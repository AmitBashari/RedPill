  Name: You give Charlotte the medication, and start as guilt takes over you tell
    her you knew the pie has nuts in it.
  Plot: Charlotte's face turns red with anger. You apologize over and over and a
    single tear rolls down your cheek. Very Johnny Depp of you, Sexy. She tells you
    to get the hell out of her face and starts dialing a number on her phone, you
    hope its not the police. Run Johnny, Run.
