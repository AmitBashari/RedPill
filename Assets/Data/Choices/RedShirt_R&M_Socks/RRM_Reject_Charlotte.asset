  Name: You avert your eyes and mumble 'No thank you' under your breath
  Plot: 'You go out to the street and start walking toward the bus station.

    You
    reflect on the woman in the elevator. Wonder what kind of person she is. Is she
    really wild? Or sweet? She does have a crazy spark in her eyes.

    Though,
    you never really saw her eyes.

    You are still rooted in thoughts as you almost
    reach the station and notice that your bus is pulling away.'
