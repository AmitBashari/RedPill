  Name: Offer Charlotte to move to her bedroom
  Plot: "Charlotte starts taking off your clothes piece by piece leaving you in your
    socks and underwear. You thank mom for always reminding you to wear clean ones
    everyday. Horrified by the thought of your mom at a moment like this, you watch
    Charlotte's back as she takes off her dress.\r\n\rShe finally turns around and
    notices your socks. A huge grin starts forming on her face. She confesses to
    be a Jerry-Hater herself."
