  Name: Take a To-Go bag to Charlotte's apartment
  Plot: You arrive at Charlotte's place and start taking the dessert out of the bag
    when the smooth sensual voice of Marvin Gaye starts playing in the apartment.
    Charlotte walks slowly towards you, her body swaying to Sexual Healing, her eyes
    focused on you. Your face turn that same shade of red again, and things start
    to heat up as Charlotte feeds you pieces of cake.
