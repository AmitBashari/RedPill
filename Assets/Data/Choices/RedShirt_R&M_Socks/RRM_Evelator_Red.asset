  Plot: 'There is a beautiful woman in the elevator as you walk in.

    She notices
    you and lowers her phone. She compliments your shirt. Your face becomes that
    same shade of red.

    She stifles a chuckle and introduces herself as Charlotte.

    She
    asks you if you would like to join her for breakfast at the new restaurant in
    town.'
