  Name: No one can fire you! Especially not him! You are the greatest!
  Plot: Your argument heat up, crew everywhere is watching and taking sides. You
    think you see a couple of bills changing hands, are they betting against you?
    Everyone is very absorbed in your argument now, they stop what they are doing
    and just watch as the manager gives you a piece of his mind. You manage to say
    your final word and an unscrewed spotlight falls from above and hits your head.
    Your body collapses to the floor. Dave the light guy won the bet.
