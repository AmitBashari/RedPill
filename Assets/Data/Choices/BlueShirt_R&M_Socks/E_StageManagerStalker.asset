  Name: How does he know about the girl in the elevator? That creep.
  Plot: 'The stage manager stutters.

    He tries to mumble something and then stops
    and looks at you with shameful eyes.

    Has he been following you? You blame
    him for stalking you and yell loudly enough for people around to hear.

    He
    tries to shush you, but you flail your hands around, shouting, "Stalker! Stalker!".

    People
    begin to take interest, the stage manager jumps around you and puts his hand
    on your mouth to keep you quiet, asking you quietly to stop shouting.

    You
    try to let him know that you can''t breath, but it''s too late.

    Your brain
    fuzzes up, and you slip slowly into darkness, the last thing you hear is the
    stage manager whispering in your ear.'
