  Name: Taking any more of YOUR shit?! what about his shitty attitude?
  Plot: The stage manager is fuming, he is trying to hold himself back. You start
    talking and he shushed you, putting his finger to your mouth as he keeps talking
    shit about you. You are aggravated. You bite his finger. He lets out a cry of
    pain and punches you in the nose. Your'e bleeding and your vision is blurred
    as you stumble around trying to find your way back to the dressing room. Suddenly,
    your foot gets caught in a stray cable on the floor, you fall and split your
    head open on a nearby table. You don't remember it being there. The last thing
    you see is the stage manager's ominous smile.
