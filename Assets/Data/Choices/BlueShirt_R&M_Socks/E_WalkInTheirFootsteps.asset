  Name: You call him an imbecile for calling Rick and Morty a childish show. This
    show is definitely not for children. But he shouldn't watch it anyway, he wouldn't
    get the jokes.
  Plot: 'The manager apologizes, confessing he wanted to watch Rick and Morty for
    a long time, but none of his friends likes the genre, so he figured that hating
    it made more sense.

    He pauses, then shouts loudly to everyone present that
    there''s a watch-over party at his place tonight, it''s definitely the time he
    followed Rick and Morty''s footsteps. Little does he know....'
