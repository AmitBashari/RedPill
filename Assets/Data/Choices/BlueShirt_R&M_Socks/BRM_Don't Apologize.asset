  Name: You shouldn't apologize for anything. The crowd is there to see you, so they
    can wait if necessary.
  Plot: 'You do your famous stretching routine. It''s a mix between Hatha Yoga and
    some quick exercises you saw online.

    You call it, Fasta Yoga. As you bend
    over to touch your knees, or The Downward Facing Dog. The stage manager walks
    by and notices your socks

    The stage manager taps you on the shoulder and
    says you can quit stretching, you are not going on stage anyway. This was the
    last straw, he can''t deal with your stuff anymore.

    He wants you gone. Today.'
