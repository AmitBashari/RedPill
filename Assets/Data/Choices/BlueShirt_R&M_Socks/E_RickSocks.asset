  Name: You do take it seriously, magic and entertainment are very important to you.
  Plot: The stage manager points at your feet and says that whoever wears such childish
    socks, can't possible take things seriously. You can't believe he just said that
    about your favorite show. YOU CAN'T EVEN. You shove the stage manager and yell
    that maybe, he's just too dumb to understand it. Nice comeback, you can't work
    for this imbecile anymore. You leave, but not before you turn around and give
    him one last degrading look.
