  Name: apologize to the stage manager profusely for your tardiness. You promise
    to make it up to him.
  Plot: 'In your dressing room, you begin the routine of putting your "Game Face"
    on. Soft music plays in the background and a small window nearby is letting a
    cool breeze in.

    Suddenly the door opens and the stage manager stands in
    the doorway. You are startled. He looks you up and down, lingering on your socks
    before apologizing for intruding.


    The stage manager says that you have
    to take this job seriously if you want to keep having it. After the major fiasco
    of last month, he won''t be taking any more of you shit.'
