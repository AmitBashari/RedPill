  Name: Confident in your level of fitness, you challenge him to a push-up contest.
  Plot: 'The manager accepts your challenge and drops to 32 push-ups.

    He gets
    up, his face is red and his grin is braggy.

    You smile and take a deep breath,
    elegantly performing 10 single handed push-ups.

    On each hand, of course.

    The
    stage manager acknowledges that magic shows are not the only thing you''re good
    at.

    You smile condescendingly and shake his hand, goosebumps cover your
    body.

    You feel his respect towards you gets deeper and you share the same
    feeling as well.'
