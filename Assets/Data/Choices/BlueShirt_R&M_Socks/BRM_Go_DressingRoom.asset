  Plot: 'You take off your clothes and fold them neatly on the chair next to you.
    You wonder if you have time to catch a quick shower before the show. Suddenly,
    the stage manager knocks on the door.

    You open it timidly, trying to hide
    yourself behind a bath towel.

    A gust of wind tries to undress you but ends
    up just blowing one of your socks to the floor.


    The stage manager looks
    at the fallen sock.

    He says cartoons are for children your socks are infantile.

    If
    you''d grow up already and stop messing around, you could become better at you
    work, and then maybe, just maybe, beautiful women elevators would give you the
    time of day.'
