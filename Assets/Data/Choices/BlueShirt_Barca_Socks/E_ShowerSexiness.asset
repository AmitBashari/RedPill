  Name: You blush and say that players are only as good as their coach
  Plot: 'The stage manager wipes a drop of sweat from your forehead. Chills run down
    your spine. You say that it was hot outside, you should probably take a shower
    before the show.

    He turns around and starts walking away.

    You say that
    the dressing room is nothing like an official locker room, but players usually
    get massaged before their game, don''t they?

    The stage manager smiles and
    takes your hand. He starts guiding you towards the back room.

    You pause,
    you don''t even know his name.

    No need for names, they only get in the way.

    You
    follow him blindly and close the door behind the two of you.'
