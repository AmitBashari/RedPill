  Plot: 'The stage manager walks out and leaves you for your prepping routine. You
    put some stage makeup on and start your breathing exercises in front of the mirror.

    You
    are a good magician. People love you. You can make the crowd eat from the palm
    of your hand.


    The buzzer rings in your room and it''s time to go on stage,
    you look at yourself one last time in the mirror and secure that pestering fly-away
    hair to the side of you head.

    Go get them tiger.'
