  Name: Grab a glass of cold water to cool yourself down
  Plot: 'You walk to the water cooler, thanking every being out there that the chatty
    contortionist isn''t there. Time for the long awaited plastic cup of cool water.
    The stage manager walks by and notes that your shoe is untied. You thank him
    and crouch down to tie it. He keeps standing there, looking at you tie your shoes.
    What a strange guy.


    The stage manager notices your socks and says Barcelona
    is his favorite team. He was looking for someone to watch the game tonight with,
    hes got a cold six pack waiting in the fridge and a coupon to a pizza place.'
