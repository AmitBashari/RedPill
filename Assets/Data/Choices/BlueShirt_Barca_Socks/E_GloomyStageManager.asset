  Name: You don't believe in mixing work and personal life, you'd rather watch the
    game alone.
  Plot: 'The stage manager lowers his eyes and says gloomily that he respects your
    choice.

    You apologize, even though you are not really sorry.

    He doesn''t
    raise his eyes and walks away. You realize this might not have been the right
    choice, but hope he won''t be too petty in the future.'
