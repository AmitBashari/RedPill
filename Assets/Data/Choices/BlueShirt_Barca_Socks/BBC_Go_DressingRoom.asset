  Plot: 'You take off your clothes and fold them neatly on the chair next to you.
    You wonder if you have time to catch a quick shower before the show. Suddenly,
    the stage manager knocks on the door.

    You open it timidly, trying to hide
    yourself behind a bath towel.

    A gust of wind tries to undress you but ends
    up just blowing one of your socks to the floor.


    The stage manager walks
    in and closes the door behind him.

    He says he never suspected your''e a
    Barcelona fan, so is he.

    He walks closer to you. He continues to say that
    it all makes sense now, that''s the reason you have such good work ethics.'
