  Name: You compare yourself to the Messi of the magic world. The only thing challenges
    your skills is your good-looks. You wink.
  Plot: 'The stage manager scoffs at you.



    He says you think you''re all that,
    but you won''t be modeling for Calvin Klein anytime soon.



    And you might
    be skillful but probably not where it actually counts, he winks back maliciously.
    Your''e free to go on stage, but your confidence definitely took a beating.'
