  Name: You shouldn't apologize for anything. The crowd is there to see you, so they
    can wait if necessary.
  Plot: 'You do your famous stretching routine.

    It''s a mix between Hatha Yoga
    and some quick exercises you saw online. You call it, Fasta Yoga.

    As you
    bend over to touch your feet, or The Downward Facing Dog, The stage manager walks
    by and notices your socks


    The stage manager walks over to you.

    You
    can see his eyes darting back and forth from your feet to your face. He looks
    conflicted.

    He tells you that you should consider this offense as a yellow
    card.'
