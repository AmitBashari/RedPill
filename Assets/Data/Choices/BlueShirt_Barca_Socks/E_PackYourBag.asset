  Plot: "The stage manager is somehow getting more irritated.\nHe yells at you that
    you are not the hot shot you think you are, and he can replace you at any time.
    Your act is not impressive, much as other things about you. \nWhat a cheap shot.
    He doesn't let you go on stage, and kicks you the hell out.\nGuess it's time
    to go pack your bags."
