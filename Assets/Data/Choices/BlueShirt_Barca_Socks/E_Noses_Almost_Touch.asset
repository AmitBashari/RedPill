  Name: A YELLOW CARD?! Who does he think he is. His piercing blue eyes don't intimidate
    you now!
  Plot: "The stage manager starts yelling at you, his eyes get smoldering in a mere
    second.\nHe pulls out all stops. You don't hold back either. You grow closer
    to each other as your argument heats up until your noses almost touch. You can
    feel his breath on your face. \nAt once, you both stop yelling, and just stand
    there, looking into each other's eyes.\nAfter what seems like forever, he pulls
    away and gestures you to the stage.\nYou're flustered, but the show must go on."
