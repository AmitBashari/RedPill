  Name: You apologize time and time again, telling the stage manager you never meant
    to put him in a bind.
  Plot: 'The stage manager is stifling a shy smile.

    He mumbles that this is
    not the bind he''d rather you put him in.

    You laugh. You never realized
    he thought of you this way. You look him deep in the eyes and ask him if he wants
    to grab a pizza with you after the show.

    He agrees and asks you to call
    him Yugi.

    You nod at him, and with a giant grin on your face you go on stage,
    delighted with a stomach full of butterflies.'
