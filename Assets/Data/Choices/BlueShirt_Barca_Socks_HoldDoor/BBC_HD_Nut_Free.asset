  Name: Charlotte asks you to order dessert while she goes to freshen up, she doesn't
    really care which one, but she is allergic to nuts. You look at the overwhelmingly
    long dessert menu, two items catch your eye.
  Plot: 'Charlotte comes back and looks at the dessert, she licks her lips and asks
    flirtatiously "is there anything sweeter than chocolate?".

    

    You say
    that last night''s Barcelona''s victory was pretty sweet.

    

    Charlotte
    tells you her cheating ex-husband was a Barcelona fan. He also used to say their
    victories were sweet.'
