  Plot: 'Choosing Red Pill has consequences.


    When you keep making choices that
    seem predetermined, You cannot stop thinking about what could have happened.


    Once
    you choose to observe reality, you cannot unsee it.



    Just like now, by
    not making a choice - the road less traveled by appeared before you.


    Remember,



    The
    choice to observe is always up to you.'
