  Name: You shouldn't apologize for anything. The crowd is there to see you, so they
    can wait if necessary.
  Plot: 'You do your famous stretching routine.

    It''s a mix between Hatha Yoga
    and some quick exercises you saw online. You call it, Fasta Yoga.

    As you
    bend over to touch your feet, or The Downward Facing Dog, The stage manager walks
    by and notices your socks


    The stage manager taps you on the shoulder and
    says you can quit stretching, you are not going on stage anyway.

    This was
    the last straw, he can''t deal with your stuff anymore.

    He wants you gone.
    Today.'
