  Name: Grab a glass of cold water to cool yourself down
  Plot: 'You walk to the water cooler, thanking every being out there that the chatty
    contortionist isn''t there. Time for the long awaited plastic cup of cool water.
    The stage manager walks by and notes that your shoe is untied. You thank him
    and crouch down to tie it. He keeps standing there, looking at you tie your shoes.
    What a strange guy.


    The stage manager notices your socks. He says that
    if you were to hit the gym in stead of potatoing on the couch watching childish
    TV shows, you wouldn''t have been so sweaty from such a short walk from the bus
    stop.'
