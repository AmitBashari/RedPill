  Name: Hold the lobby door for the beautiful woman.
  Plot: 'The woman says chivalry is not to be ignored and invites you to join her
    for lunch.

    She introduces herself as Charlotte and then proceeds to lead
    the way to the restaurant.

    It''s a Japanese-Greek fusion themed restaurant
    with a giant neon sign on the side that reads "FOOD".

    You try to not judge
    books by their cover.


    After finishing the surprisingly edible meal you
    ponder on plans for dessert.'
